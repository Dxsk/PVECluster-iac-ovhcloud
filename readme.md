# 🚀 Proxmox VE Lab Environment on OVH Public Cloud

This project allows you to automatically deploy and configure a Proxmox VE environment on OVH Public Cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. ⚡️

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### 🏗️ /deployer

Contains the OpenTofu (Terraform) code to provision the infrastructure:

- 🖥️ Creates Debian 12 instances on OVH Public Cloud
- 🌐 Sets up networking and security groups
- 💾 Manages additional block storage volumes
- 📤 Outputs instance information for Ansible

Key files:
- `main.tf`- 📋 Main infrastructure definition
- `variables.tf`- ⚙️ Variable declarations
- `outputs.tf`- 📊 Output definitions
- `providers.tf`- 🔌 Provider configurations

### 🛠️ /provisioner 

Contains the Ansible playbooks to configure the instances:

- 📦 Installs and configures Proxmox VE
- 🔧 Sets up networking and storage
- 🔒 Configures security settings
- ✅ Manages post-installation tasks

Key files:
- `site.yml`- 📘 Main playbook
- `inventory.yml`- 📝 Dynamic inventory (generated)
- `group_vars/`- ⚙️ Group variables
- `roles/`- 🎭 Ansible roles for different components

## 🔄 Usage Flow

1. Use the deployer to create infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd deployer
   tofu init
   tofu plan
   tofu apply
   ```

2. Use the provisioner to configure instances:
   ```bash
   cd ../provisioner
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml site.yml
   ```
